Hummingword - [HTML5 Word Clouds](http://www.hackyon.com/hummingword)
===============================

Create stunning word clouds right in your browser using nothing but HTML5. This is meant to be both a showcase and an experiment of basic HTML5 technologies. 

The HTML5 technologies used are:
* Canvas
* Web workers
* Fullscreen

Suggestions are welcomed. I was thinking about making a version where clouds conform to predefined shapes, as with [Tagxedo](http://www.tagxedo.com/). Let me know if you would like to see this happen.

The source should be pretty self-explanatory, but feel free to PM me if you have questions.
